# Study on Model-Based RL:

Currently just a notebooks directly with some examples:

   Random model building
   Dyna-Q Agent, need to add Dyna-Q+ 
   Prioritized Sweeps

Up next, I would like to try out monte carlo tree search (MCTC), and then approaches that
involve the use of function approximators (Deep Model-Based RL).
